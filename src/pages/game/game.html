          The main goal of the game is to perform arithmetics operations for
          complex fractions as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 4 kinds of arithmetics operations for complex fractions: to
          double, to tripple, to find one-half, to find one-third. One of these
          operations is selected randomly - you should perform it during the
          game. It is indicated in the top of the window.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the operation name there is a row of complex fractions which
          were randomly generated for this game. You should perform the
          operation for every complex fraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          To compose an answer you should use circle parts which show parts of
          complex fractions. Try to drag some circles into the answer block
          while you get the correct answer. Please, don't forget to cut
          fractions.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should click the button to submit your answer. If the answer is
          correct the button will be green but if the answer is wrong the button
          will be red.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you perform the operation for every complex fractions the game
          will be finished and you will see your score - the time while you
          perform operations. If you play twice the game will show the result of
          your speed: the game you have played was going faster or slower as
          prevous one, the difference between them.
        </p>
        <p>Good luck!</p>
